    "My ideal job would be to apply my knowledge of data to make valid predictions about subsets of the population. I would like to work with large datasets to understand humanity better. An example of this would be working at Spotify, understanding how to better understand people's music preferences. Other cases may include working with eCommerce to find out consumer purchasing preferences. I would like to use data to learn more about people. Image recognition is also very interesting. In the same line of thought, emotion recognition through images could be explored further to help better service in restaurants for example. I think behavioral analytics is super cool and would be interested in learning more. "
