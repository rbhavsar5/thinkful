    "Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below."

    "2. Another possibility  would be to use KNN to tally up dollar amount of each category separately as four different features. Then, you could use KNN to make a binary decision boundary between on time payments and late. Once established you can predict whether a payment would be on time or not based on past data. \n",
